"SHOWA KAYO MUSICAL"

00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:24,999
"1988"

3
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:28,015
ARE YOU OKAY?

4
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,661
I HAVE RETURNED TO THE SHOWA ERA

5
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:50,004
I'VE ALWAYS WISHED
I COULD GO TO A DIFFERENT TIME

6
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:56,014
I HAVE ARRIVED AT A DISTANT FUTURE.

7
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,950
REIWA?

8
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,087
- WHAT IS REIWA?   - WHAT?
- WHAT?   - WHEN IS THIS PLACE... HERE?

9
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:04,022
WHERE AM I?

10
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,958
GOOD MORNING!

11
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,560
MOTHER... OUCH!

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,930
YOU... HUSBAND?

13
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,866
EH?

14
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,769
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND!

15
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:20,272
I WENT OUT WITH HIM.

16
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:25,272
AND I FOUND MYSELF IN A STRANGE WORLD.

17
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,951
A CALM, GENTLE, DREAMLIKE TIME.

18
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:34,987
BUT...

19
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:37,122
SO, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A WRITER?

20
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:43,996
I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO
THAN SELL AND MAKE MONEY.

21
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:46,131
THAT'S A LIE.

22
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:57,142


23
00:01:57,142 --> 00:02:02,915
THIS IS THE STORY OF MY GREAT ADVENTURE

24
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:12,615
"SHOWA KAYO MUSICAL
MATA AU HI MADE"

25
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:19,364
AH~! IRASSHAI~.

26
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:25,170
BEFORE LEAVING ON A JOURNEY INTO THE FUTURE,
I WAS SINGING AT MY PARENTS' SNACK BAR

27
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:34,580


28
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:41,954


29
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:49,695


30
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:53,665


31
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:58,904


32
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:02,774


33
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:06,245


34
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:10,082


35
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:14,920


36
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,256


37
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:19,758
THAT'S GOOD~.

38
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:22,094


39
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:25,564


40
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:28,433


41
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,936


42
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:38,577


43
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:43,949


44
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:49,821


45
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:57,096


46
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:04,599
- MOTHER~ WATER~
- YES, MA'AM.

47
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:08,907
OH... OH... OH... OH.

48
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:12,544
OH, SAE-CHAN.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE MOMOE.

49
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:19,084
UEKI-SAN, YOU WERE SLEEPING.
500 YEN FOR THE REQUEST.

50
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:22,554
I WAS BATHING WITH MY BODY.

51
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,457
OH, SAE. TO YAMAOKA-SAN.

52
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:28,260
HA~Y.

53
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,163
- MR. YAMAOKA
- OH, I'VE BEEN WAITING, WAITING.

54
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:34,766
THAT WAS GOOD.
THE CHOICE OF MUSIC WAS EXCELLENT.

55
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:38,566
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- I WAS SO IMPRESSED.

56
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:45,777
YES, I'LL SING ANYTHING YOU WANT
FOR 500 YEN PER SONG. I'LL SING ANYTHING.

57
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:48,680
SAE-CHAN, HOW DID IT GO?
THE AUDITION THE OTHER DAY.

58
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,650
- SHE LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOW.
- WHY AGAIN?

59
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,004
I HEARD THAT SHE SAID
DURING THE INTERVIEW,

60
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,889
"I DON'T LIKE SONGS. I HATE SONGS!"

61
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:04,229
OH, NO! WHY DID SHE SAID THAT?
SHE LOVE SONGS, DON'T SHE?

62
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:06,729
SHE'S NOT BEING HONEST.

63
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:11,536


64
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:14,906
OH, IT'S ME! IT'S ME!
MIFUNE-CHAN, WAIT.

65
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:18,410
OKAY, OKAY, I'M GOING.

66
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:28,420


67
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,091


68
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:40,265
TODAY SOMEONE IS INTOXICATED BY SONG
AND THE SONG HEALS AND FILLS THEM.

69
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:45,137
SONGS ARE FOR EVERYONE.

70
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:49,437
BUT TO ME, IT'S JUST CRAP.

71
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:58,517
MY FATHER WAS A LYRICIST WHO
WROTE SONGS THAT DIDN'T SELL.

72
00:05:58,517 --> 00:06:03,889
LIVING ONLY FOR HIS OWN DREAMS...
AND THEN HE DIED.

73
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:10,228


74
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,531
HATE...

75
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:18,236
I HATE SONGS AND THIS ERA...

76
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:21,273
AND MYSELF BURIED HERE...

77
00:06:21,273 --> 00:06:29,073


78
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,861
AUDITION, SINGER CATEGORY.

79
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,263
PASSED THE FIRST ROUND!

80
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:47,566
- YOU PASSED!
- YES!

81
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:53,939
- OH MY GOD~ I'M SO SICK OF IT.
- WHY?

82
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:59,177
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THE SECOND ROUND
ANYWAY, AND I'M NOT INTERESTED IN IT.

83
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:01,655
HMMM... I GUESS THAT'S THE USUAL.

84
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,216
SAE-SAN, YOU CAN BE A SINGER.

85
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,052
YES, YES. GANBA RUMBA!
GANBA RUMBA!

86
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:11,223
- HEY~ SOY SAUCE FACE
- I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT.

87
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,526
WHAT? YES!

88
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:20,232
ISONO-SAN, LEAVE IT ON MY DESK.
IT'S TOO HEAVY TO BRING TO SALES.

89
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,167
NO, DO IT YOURSELF...

90
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:28,540
IT'S A GIRL'S JOB, RIGHT?
WE'RE THE ONES WHO MAKE THE MONEY.

91
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,475
WHY DO I HAVE TO...

92
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:33,411
WELL THEN, NICE TO MEET YOU!

93
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,711
- DON'T MIND
- DON'T MIND

94
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:44,122
WHAT'S WRONG?

95
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:46,758
MIURA-SAN.

96
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:54,432
YOU GUYS, WHEN A 5'9" LIKE ME.
I CAN SEE THE INSIDE JOB AT HAND.

97
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,269
OH, MY GOD.

98
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,204
OH, NO!

99
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:05,076
FUTURE STARS WANTED...
PASSED THE SCREENING PROCESS.

100
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:08,713
IT'S TRUE.
SAE-CHAN IS AIMING TO BE A SINGER.

101
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:11,616
NO... THIS KIND OF THING
DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

102
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,885
MY MOTHER IS SENDING IT TO ME ON HER OWN.

103
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:16,721
I TOLD HER I WAS INTERESTED IN IT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE A LONG TIME AGO.

104
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:20,892
I'M GOING TO BE YANKEE, AREN'T I?

105
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:28,767
HOW ABOUT THE FUTURE OVER HERE?

106
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:33,071
"BACK TO THE FUTURE" ADVANCE TICKETS?

107
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:36,107
WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE THE OFFICE AFTER WORK.

108
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:40,812
I BOUGHT A NEW CAR.
LET'S GO FOR A DRIVE.

109
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,248
OKAY.

110
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:48,086
I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.
CIAO.

111
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:50,555
SO COOL~!

112
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:54,259
YOU'RE LEAVING ON YOUR OWN
TERMS WITHOUT ME?

113
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:58,697
YOU ARE QUICK-TEMPERED. BESIDES, I WANT
TO WORK EVEN IF I'M MARRIED.

114
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:01,438
YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET
MARRIED AND STAY IN THE

115
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:04,202
COMPANY, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK.

116
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:07,706
HIGHLY EDUCATED, HIGH INCOME, HIGH HEIGHT.

117
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:10,609
IF IT'S MIURA-SAN, A THREE-TALENTED MAN...
I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS~.

118
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:13,578
HE'S BEING PRAISED AGAIN.

119
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:17,716
HEY, WE'RE ALL GOING OUT FOR A DRINK TODAY.

120
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:23,588
THIS MONTH, MIURA IS THE TOP SALESMAN.
IT'S A PRE-PROMOTION CELEBRATION FOR SURE.

121
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:27,392
I'M SORRY, I'M A LITTLE BUSY TODAY.

122
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:30,745
WHAT'S THAT?
YOU TURNED ME DOWN YESTERDAY TOO, RIGHT?

123
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,505
I HAD TO PICK UP MY CHILD.

124
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:38,325
YOU'RE SO COLD. IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR
CHILD, WHY DON'T YOU JUST BE A HOUSEWIFE?

125
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:39,325
I'M SORRY.

126
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:43,404
- RIGHT? HE HAVE NARROW SHOULDERS.
- HMM?

127
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,547
I'M NOT GOING EITHER.

128
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,251
HUH? ISONO, YOU'RE SINGLE.

129
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:58,751
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO HECKLE MY BOSS.

130
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:03,492
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

131
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,930
TO A BOSS WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

132
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:12,968
HEY, SAE.

133
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,442
WHAT, WHAT~...

134
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:24,115
YOU'D BETTER WATCH HOW YOU TALK OR
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STAY IN THE COMPANY.

135
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:26,151
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET MARRIED.

136
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:30,889
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT TODAY
IS THE DAY, ISONO?

137
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:35,827
OUCH! DID YOU HIT ME?

138
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:39,827
- I DIDN'T HIT YOU.
- YOU HIT ME!

139
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,902
SHE HIT ME, DIDN'T SHE?

140
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:48,139
THERE'S NO NEED TO HIT ANYTHING.

141
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:52,811
THE BOSS WAS VERY ANGRY. IF YOU DO
A BAD JOB, YOU'LL BE FIRED FOR SOME REASON.

142
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:54,581
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S
A TEMPORARY JOB.

143
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:57,315
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO
WORK, YOU HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT.

144
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:59,515
I'M WORKING!

145
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,565
ISONO-SAN... DON'T DO ANYTHING UNNECESSARY.

146
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:15,500
EH?

147
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,939
BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE MY POSITION WORSE.

148
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:23,639
I HAVE TO GO PICK MY CHILD UP.

149
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,451
- ANYWAY, I'M GOING TOO.
- WHAT ABOUT THE MOVIE?

150
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:36,751
I HAVE TO GO WITH THE DIRECTOR AT LEAST.

151
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,523
GO TO THE MOVIES WITH SOMEONE.

152
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:49,662
KEEP SMILING. WOMEN ARE CHARMING.

153
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,478
I'M HUNGRY.
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

154
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:03,748
WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND?
WE'RE GOING TO EAT AT A RESTAURANT.

155
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:06,548
"SNACK BAR
THE ARK"

156
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:15,260
- WAKA, I WAS BORN IN THE WRONG ERA.
- WHAT? YOU WANT EDO OR MEIJI?

157
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:23,968
WRONG! A KINDER, LESS HAWKEN-ESQUE ERA.
NOT THE PAST, MORE THE FUTURE!

158
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:27,772
YOU LIKE THE FUTURE.
INFLUENCE OF THE MOVIE?

159
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:32,444
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT? IF ONLY
THERE WAS A BETTER FUTURE TO LIVE IN.

160
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:34,379
HMMM...

161
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:40,318
I DON'T FIT IN THIS TIME PERIOD.

162
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:45,990
SOCIETY, TRENDS, THE WAY
PEOPLE THINK, AND MUSIC.

163
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,893
COME ON, DON'T BE ROTTEN,
LET'S GO DANCING!

164
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:54,833
I MET A GUY THE OTHER DAY. HE SAID HE'D
TAKE ME TO A NEW DISCO IN SHIBAURA.

165
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,135
OH, IT'S ME, IT'S ME!

166
00:12:57,135 --> 00:13:01,973
SAE-CHAN, SAE-CHAN.

167
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:05,243
SAE! REQUEST.

168
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,745
AIYO.

169
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,681
SORRY.

170
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:11,616


171
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:16,254
I LIKE THIS ERA. BYE-BYE~.

172
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,189
BYE BYE~.

173
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:27,432


174
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:35,306


175
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:44,449


176
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:48,786


177
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:53,291


178
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:57,162


179
00:13:57,162 --> 00:14:00,899


180
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,099


181
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:10,074
AH~!
SAE, AREN'T YOU DRINKING A LITTLE TOO MUCH?

182
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:15,880
IF I DON'T DRINK,
I CAN'T SING "LONELY CHAPLIN" ELEVEN TIMES.

183
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,750
EVERYONE SINGS TOO MANY POPULAR SONGS.

184
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,087
ISN'T THAT GOOD?
YOU CAN FEEL THE SAME WAY.

185
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:25,023
I'M NOT SURE.

186
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,759
YOU HAVE ANOTHER AUDITION TOMORROW, RIGHT?
ARE YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?

187
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:34,265
IT'S OKAY. I'M NOT GOING TO GET IT ANYWAY.
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ACCEPTED IN THIS AGE.

188
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:38,570
- I MIGHT AS WELL TAKE OVER THIS STORE.
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!

189
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,660
IF YOU DO THAT, I'LL HATE YOU.

190
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:42,774
YOU'LL BE RESENTED BY ME
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

191
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:45,443
BECAUSE OF ME, YOU HAD
TO GIVE UP YOUR DREAM.

192
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:47,445
I DON'T HATE THAT.

193
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:51,249
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO
TAKE OVER THIS RESTAURANT, FINE.

194
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:57,155
BUT IF YOU USE IT AS A REASON
TO GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAM...

195
00:14:57,155 --> 00:15:00,091
EVEN MY MOTHER.
YOU'VE GIVEN UP A LOT, HAVEN'T YOU?

196
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:03,728
YOU, TO RAISE ME.

197
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:09,601
WELL, BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING I LIKE.
I WISH I HAD STUDIED, I GUESS.

198
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:12,401
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO STUDY?

199
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,242
- NOTHING
- MISHU-CHAN, LOOK AT THIS!

200
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:19,177
WHAT? WHAT?

201
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:21,977
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT

202
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:30,615
IT'S THE TIMES. IT'S THE TIMES, EVERYTHING.

203
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,860
IT'S KARA GLASS.

204
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:45,937


205
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:51,442
IF YOU LIVED IN A DIFFERENT TIME.
I WONDER IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY.

206
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:54,242
YES. DEFINITELY.

207
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:15,400


208
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,303
THANKS FOR THE BEER.

209
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:20,271
WEIRD.

210
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:24,409


211
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:30,281
THIS CANDY IS "MOSHIMO AME".
WHAT "MOSHIMO AME"?

212
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,751
THIS UNIVERSE IS NOT ONE.

213
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:36,788
THERE IS A WORLD WHERE YOU RUN A BAKERY.

214
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:43,094
THERE ARE WORLDS WHERE YOU ARE LIVING IN
THE FAR FUTURE. IT'S A MULTIVERSE THEORY.

215
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:48,766
YOU LICK THIS CANDY AND WISH, "WHAT
IF THIS WORLD WERE LIKE THIS."

216
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:53,571
AND THEN YOU TRAVEL TO ONE
OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WORLDS.

217
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:58,209
HUH?

218
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:01,713
THANKS. ARE YOU TRYING TO COMFORT ME?

219
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:06,050
ARE YOU A TRAVELER?
YOU DON'T LOOK FAMILIAR.

220
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,720
I JUST LIKE TO SING.

221
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,392
I WAS PASSING BY THIS STORE,
AND I HEARD YOU SINGING.

222
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:17,295
OH, DO YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS?

223
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:23,901
I'LL SING TODAY! I WANT TO
SING LOUSILY AND LET IT FLOW.

224
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:29,774
OKAY, TODAY... YOU'LL SING A SONG
THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

225
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:34,274
- EH~? WHAT IS IT?
- MAY I?

226
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:38,414
OH WELL.

227
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:59,871


228
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:11,883


229
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:15,219
HOW MUCH DID YOU DRINK?

230
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,890
I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY.

231
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:31,602


232
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:44,415


233
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,752


234
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,788
HUH? WHAT'S THIS...

235
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:58,196


236
00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:04,869


237
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:07,205


238
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:10,241
- AH! SAE!
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

239
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:12,376
OH?

240
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:16,214
HEY... THE MAN

241
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:20,518
SIR?
HEY... MISTER!

242
00:19:20,518 --> 00:19:24,318
- MISTER?
- SAE!

243
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:33,397


244
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:39,737


245
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:46,077


246
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:48,277


247
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:05,726
DID I SLEPT HERE?

248
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:09,500
OH MY GOD! 8 O'CLOCK!

249
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,000
OH, CAB, CAB, CAB!

250
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:18,442
QUIET CAR... OH, SORRY.

251
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:22,742
- JINGU-BASHI 1 TO 23.
- YES.

252
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:34,492
DA~KA~RA! WHERE ARE WE?

253
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:37,295
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS BIG BUILDING IS!

254
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:42,133
- THAT'S THE ADDRESS YOU GAVE ME!
- ISN'T THIS SHIMURAYA, THE MEAT BUN SHOP?

255
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:46,470
SHIMURAYA IS A MUCH SHABBIER BUILDING!

256
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,807
- THIS IS IT!
- NO, IT'S NOT!

257
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:53,477
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH HER?
JUST DON'T PAY!

258
00:20:53,477 --> 00:20:56,314
- WHAT? WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE!
- LET GO!

259
00:20:56,314 --> 00:21:00,084
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LEFT ME HERE~!

260
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:02,987
OH MY GOD!

261
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:05,287
HUH...

262
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:10,959
WHERE AM I?

263
00:21:13,431 --> 00:21:16,767
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
- WAKA!

264
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:21,439
GOOD MORNING, SAE. WHAT IS IT?
EIGHTIES STYLE? THAT'S SO FASHIONABLE!

265
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,147
WAKA, YOU TOO.
HOW'S YOUR TOSAKA?

266
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:26,277
HOW ABOUT AN HOUR'S TOSSER
FOR BLOW-DRYING EVERY MORNING?

267
00:21:26,277 --> 00:21:31,148
HUH? AND YOUR CLOTHES ARE KIND OF PLAIN!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

268
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:35,453
NO, IT'S NORMAL.
COME ON, WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE. LET'S GO.

269
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:38,456
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- COMPANY.

270
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:45,596


271
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,133
- WAKA! WAKA! WAKA, WAKA, WAKA!
- WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

272
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,803
- OH MY GOD! VIDEOPHONE!
- STOP IT.

273
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:57,642


274
00:21:57,642 --> 00:22:00,244
OH, WAKA... WAKA, WAIT A MINUTE!

275
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:04,749
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

276
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:08,085
- WHAT IS THIS?
- DID YOU FORGET YOUR EMPLOYEE ID CARD?

277
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:10,585
SHA... EMPLOYEE ID CARD?

278
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:14,191
THERE IS.

279
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:19,930


280
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,101
OH, NO.
LIKE A NEWBORN FAWN...

281
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:26,037
WE'RE GOING TO GO.

282
00:22:26,037 --> 00:22:29,974


283
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:33,811
- GOOD MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING, NATSUKI-SAN. ISONO-SAN.

284
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,447
GOOD MORNING...

285
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:42,953
KAORI-SAN, ARE YOU AT THE BABY'S OFFICE? ALL
THE TIME. I LEAVE THEM IN THE NURSERY.

286
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:45,456
- NURSERY...
- GOOD MORNING.

287
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:48,292
- KAEDE-CHAN, GOOD MORNING.
- PLEASE GIVE MY BEST REGARDS.

288
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:50,327
- YES, WE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
- SEE YOU LATER.

289
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:57,127
- MOMMY GOT AWAY.
- NURSERY... FOR COMPANY?

290
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:05,941
WHERE'S THIS PLACE?

291
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:11,545
NEKUMAN INNOVATION SHIMURAYA.

292
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,450
BUT THE UNIFORMS ARE DIFFERENT.
THE BUILDING IS DIFFERENT.

293
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:24,428
WORK IS THE SAME.

294
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:28,299
WE WERE ALL THE SAME.

295
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,935
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE FUTURE!

296
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:33,437
- OH~!
- WHAT?

297
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:38,309
- WOW~!
- WHAT'S UP? AHAHAHA... WHAT'S THE STORY?

298
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:41,509


299
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:46,350
- WHAT?
- OH, NOISY!

300
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,587
- WHAT'S WRONG, SAE?
- A... ROBOT!

301
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:55,126
WHAT? IT'S OUR GUIDE, ROBO-KUN.
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER.

302
00:23:55,126 --> 00:24:01,398
- GOOD MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING.

303
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,301
- HE'S SMILING...
- LET'S DO OUR BEST FOR ANOTHER DAY.

304
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:09,073
LET'S DO OUR BEST!
BYE BYE.

305
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:16,247
- EMPLOYEE?
- EMPLOYEE... NOT.

306
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:20,084
- THIS EXPO? WHAT EXPO?
- HUH?

307
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:24,255
I MEAN, ISONO-SAN, YOU MUST BE GOING
THROUGH A MENTAL BREAKDOWN

308
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,557
- MENTAL? YES,   - YOU HAVE MENTAL.
- THERE'S THAT.

309
00:24:26,557 --> 00:24:30,261
BUT I'M GLAD YOU SAID IT.
THERE WAS A SEXUAL HARASSER.

310
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,292
SEX...?

311
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:34,431
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FORCED
DRINKING. IT'S POWER HARASSMENT.

312
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,546
POWER?

313
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,936
OUR COMPANY, COMPLIANCE
IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

314
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:42,573
CON...?
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

315
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:46,277
BUT THANKS TO ISONO-SAN.
THANKS TO YOU.

316
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:50,948
I'LL SAY IT CLEARLY.
I DON'T THINK HE CAN STAY HERE ANY LONGER.

317
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:55,286
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

318
00:24:55,286 --> 00:25:00,057
WHAT? IT WASN'T ME. IT'S THE DIRECTOR!
THE DIRECTOR COULDN'T STAY.

319
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:02,526
THE DIRECTOR?
SEE, SEE, SEE.

320
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:08,326
DIRECTOR ISHIBASHI! WE HAVE YOUR DOCUMENTS.

321
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:14,269
THIS

322
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:18,858
2022?

323
00:25:18,882 --> 00:25:22,721
OH, ISONO-KUN,
SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY...

324
00:25:22,746 --> 00:25:28,252
REI... WA 4 YEARS? REIWA?

325
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:30,763
- WHAT IS "REIWA"?
- WHAT?

326
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,732
WHAT? THIS PLACE IS... WHEN IS THIS PLACE?

327
00:25:32,756 --> 00:25:34,956
WHERE AM I?

328
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:41,465
OH, THERE'S A PHONE CALL.

329
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:44,435
- SAE, ISN'T THAT YOUR BAG?
- EH? BAG

330
00:25:44,435 --> 00:25:47,304
- YEAH. SAE, ISN'T IT?
- HMM?

331
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:50,941


332
00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:53,577
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

333
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:55,946
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT?
- WHAT?

334
00:25:55,946 --> 00:25:57,239
- NO ANSWER?
- NOT ANSWERING?

335
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:57,891
SMART PHONE.

336
00:25:57,915 --> 00:26:01,518
- SMART PHONE?
- SO, THIS ONE. QUICKLY, QUICKLY.

337
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,722
HUH? HUH? HUH?

338
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:09,222
OH, YOU LOST IT.
WELL, I HOPE THAT'S OK.

339
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,831
- OH, WAA!
- WHAT~?

340
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:16,066
WHAT IS THIS~!

341
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:21,538
WHAT? ME? I'M KIND OF CUTE!
I'M CUTE!

342
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:26,076
- YOU'RE CUTE. YOU SAY SO YOURSELF?
- CUTE~!

343
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:28,276
UM~ SAE-CHAN.

344
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,616
WHO ARE YOU?

345
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:36,086
NO, IT'S MIURA.

346
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:40,257
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MIURA-SAN?
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA OR NOT.

347
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:43,294
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS, HAVEN'T I?

348
00:26:43,294 --> 00:26:49,934
MIURA-KUN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A QUIET,
GOOD-NATURED YOUNG MAN. HE'S LIKE A SHEEP.

349
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:55,272
EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT FROM USUAL.

350
00:26:55,272 --> 00:27:00,044
WE ALL CAME TO THE FUTURE...

351
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:05,382
I DON'T THINK SO. AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAME TO THE FUTURE?

352
00:27:05,382 --> 00:27:14,391
NO. WE ALL LIVE HERE IN THE FUTURE.
ANOTHER WORLD?

353
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:17,895
ARE YOU OKAY?

354
00:27:17,895 --> 00:27:20,731
CAN I GO HOME TODAY?

355
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:24,902
UMMM... YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA!
YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE FEELING WELL.

356
00:27:24,902 --> 00:27:29,406
IF YOU WANT.
YOU CAN WORK REMOTELY IF YOU WANT.

357
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:31,909
- REMOTE?
- YES.

358
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:33,909
COMMUNICATE REMOTELY...

359
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:38,349
TELEPATHY...?

360
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:46,924


361
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:50,761
WOW! THAT'S A LOT....

362
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:55,265
WHAT IS THAT... SCARY!

363
00:27:55,265 --> 00:28:01,872


364
00:28:01,872 --> 00:28:06,710
JULIE.... THERE ARE SONGS
FROM THE SHOWA ERA.

365
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,513
- OH, DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP THE MUSIC?
- OH, IT'S FINE.

366
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:13,313


367
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:24,395
I'M GLAD THIS IS IT....

368
00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:26,595
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

369
00:28:33,404 --> 00:28:36,907
MOTHER!

370
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:40,411
MOTHER!

371
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:42,411


372
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:49,084
PARFAIT.

373
00:28:51,422 --> 00:28:53,722
COFFEE SHOP?

374
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:03,229
TAPI... CAFE?

375
00:29:06,503 --> 00:29:09,206
- MOTHER... OW!
- OUCH!

376
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,709
I'M SORRY, I'M STILL PREPARING...

377
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:17,581
OH... WELCOME BACK.

378
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:23,053
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.
ARE YOU DONE WITH WORK ALREADY?

379
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:26,723
YOU DIDN'T COME HOME YESTERDAY.

380
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,614
I DON'T MEAN TO NAG YOU, BUT IF
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY OUT OVERNIGHT,

381
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:32,529
YOU SHOULD TELL ME.

382
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:36,066
ARE YOU... MY HUSBAND?

383
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,001
WHAT?

384
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:40,737
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND!

385
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:44,818
NO... SORRY, I DIDN'T
MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

386
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:48,412
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO LIVE
TOGETHER, THERE ARE SOME RULES...

387
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:52,916
WHAT? LIVING TOGETHER, YOU AND I?

388
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:58,422
- WHAT ABOUT MY MOTHER?
- OH... UNFORTUNATELY, NOT ANYMORE.

389
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,357
NO WAY...

390
00:30:00,357 --> 00:30:06,163
- SHE'S PROBABLY UP IN THE SKY RIGHT NOW.
- NO WAY...

391
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:09,433
JUST BECAUSE THE PLANE WON'T
MAKE IT IN TIME... HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

392
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:14,633
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY... WHAT'S WRONG?
ARE YOU OKAY? HEY! SAE-SAN!

393
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:21,778
FRANCE... STUDY ABROAD?

394
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:26,950
YESTERDAY, MIFUNE-SAN SUDDENLY WENT BACK
TO JAPAN TEMPORARILY. HE LEFT THIS MORNING.

395
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,587
SHE WAS WAITING TO SEE YOU, BUT...
SHE DIDN'T CALL YOU?

396
00:30:30,587 --> 00:30:32,956
- PHONE CALL?
- TO YOUR PHONE.

397
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:38,256
SMA.... OH, PERHAPS....

398
00:30:40,697 --> 00:30:43,467
IS THIS A PHONE?

399
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,970
MAYBE A MONTH LATER.
HE SAID HE'S GOING BACK.

400
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,170


401
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:57,181
MOTHER. IN THIS DAY AND AGE,
SHE LIVES FREELY.

402
00:30:57,181 --> 00:31:01,919
- HMM?
- I'M SORRY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

403
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:10,093
IN OTHER WORDS, THE SNACK BAR CLOSED
MANY YEARS AGO. AND NOW IT'S A COFFEE SHOP.

404
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:13,964
- CALL IT A CAFE.
- AND YOU ARE THE MANAGER.

405
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:16,967
I'M HIRED.

406
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:23,273
I MEAN... YOU DRANK TOO MUCH ALCOHOL AND
YOU HAVE A TEMPORARY MEMORY LAPSE.

407
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:26,109
IS IT SOMETHING YOU FORGET LIKE THAT?

408
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:28,946
I DRANK TOO MUCH YESTERDAY.

409
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:31,746


410
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:37,955
BY THE WAY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

411
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:44,595
- REALLY?
- I'LL REMEMBER IT SOON, BUT JUST IN CASE.

412
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:50,133
NOBI. NOBI NOBORU.

413
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:53,804
NOBI.

414
00:31:53,804 --> 00:31:58,075
PLAYWRIGHT. I HAVE A THEATER COMPANY
SEPARATE FROM THE CAFÉ.

415
00:31:58,075 --> 00:32:04,248
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT. I REMEMBER NOW.
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE SAID THIS.

416
00:32:04,248 --> 00:32:08,118
WHAT? OH... MY MOTHER TOLD ME.

417
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:12,956
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
SHE OFTEN COME TO SEE OUR PLAY.

418
00:32:12,956 --> 00:32:17,427
THAT'S WHY
I'VE BEEN INVITED TO THIS CAFE.

419
00:32:17,427 --> 00:32:24,101
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

420
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:26,901
- IT'S A STAGE.
- WHAT?

421
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:34,278
AHHH! THE STAGE...

422
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:36,780
YOU REALLY LIVE HERE...

423
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:43,120
I CAN'T BELIEVE A PLAYWRIGHT LIVES ON
STAGE. PHEW... THAT'S A VALUABLE EXPERIENCE.

424
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,789
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE.

425
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:49,660
A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO DON'T KNOW
EACH OTHER VERY WELL UNDER ONE ROOF?

426
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,663
AFTER ALL THIS TIME?
IT'S JUST A SHARED HOUSE.

427
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:57,901
- WE'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE.
- IT'S OKAY. I'M A HERBIVORE.

428
00:32:57,901 --> 00:33:03,601
- YOU'RE A HERBIVORE.
- HERBIVORE! I'M A HERBIVORE.

429
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:09,246
YES. TAPIOCA. YOU WANT SOME?

430
00:33:09,246 --> 00:33:12,749
TAPI... TAPIOCA?

431
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:14,949
TAPIOCA.

432
00:33:19,423 --> 00:33:23,260


433
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:28,765
THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT! IN MY MOUTH!
IT LOOKS LIKE A TADPOLE!

434
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:33,270
WHAT... YOU'VE NEVER EATEN IT BEFORE?

435
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,572
WHAT IS THIS? A CANDY?

436
00:33:35,572 --> 00:33:37,872
IT'S NOT CANDY.

437
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:41,443
CANDY!

438
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,605
IF YOU LIVED IN A DIFFERENT TIME.
I WONDER IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY.

439
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:49,638
YES.

440
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:55,792
THAT TRAVELER....

441
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:59,592
OKAY, I'M GOING TO OPEN SOON.

442
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:14,244
DELICIOUS.

443
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:16,944
TAPIOCA. DELICIOUS!

444
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:21,752
SO, CANDY!

445
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:25,088
- MOSHIMO CANDY!
- MOSHIMO CANDY?

446
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:27,124
YES! A CANDY THAT MAKES
"WHAT IF" COME TRUE.

447
00:34:27,124 --> 00:34:32,763
BECAUSE OF THAT FUNNY CANDY
I CAME TO A DIFFERENT WORLD.

448
00:34:32,763 --> 00:34:37,267
- BECAUSE I WISHED FOR IT.
- WHAT DID YOU WISH FOR?

449
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:40,103
IF I LIVED IN THE FUTURE.

450
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:42,439
THE FUTURE, YOU'RE HERE IN THE PRESENT.

451
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:46,109
THAT'S NOT IT.
I AM FROM THE SHOWA PERIOD.

452
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:48,945
- HUH...
- COMPUTERS ARE SO...

453
00:34:48,945 --> 00:34:51,982
- IT WAS THIS BIG.
- HA~N.

454
00:34:51,982 --> 00:34:56,286
WAKA WAS WEARING A BODYCON LIKE THIS
AND WENT TO THE DISCO EVERY NIGHT!

455
00:34:56,286 --> 00:35:00,257
WAIT, DISCOS ARE STILL AROUND?

456
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:04,995
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DO YOU DO?
- STUDYING FOR A CERTIFICATION?

457
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:08,932
WAKA? WAKA, THE GIRL WHO WANTS
TO BE THE CENTER OF A BALL, IS STUDYING?

458
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:14,404
- HEY, "TAMANOKOSHI" IS A DEAD WORD.
- WHAT A BAD TIME WE ARE LIVING IN.

459
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,240
TAPIOCA SOY LATTE MARRON
GRANDE SIZE, TWO FOR YOU.

460
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,413
AND I'M LIVING WITH A GUY. WITH A GUY I
DON'T EVEN KNOW! HE'S THE MANAGER.

461
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,416
SHARED HOUSE WITH A MANAGER?

462
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:30,921
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- MATCHING APP.

463
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:34,558
- MATCHING?
- YOU'RE THE ONE...

464
00:35:34,558 --> 00:35:38,094
IT'S LIKE A BLIND DATE. THEY INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOMEONE WHO MATCHES YOUR REQUIREMENTS.

465
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:42,566
- OH, I GOT A MATCH!
- IS THAT A MATCH?

466
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:46,937
PIYOMARU, 34 YEARS OLD.
ANNUAL INCOME, 3.4 MILLION.

467
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:50,273
OCCUPATION: MANUFACTURING.
HOBBIES: READING.

468
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:54,778
SOBER~! I DON'T WANT TO GO
ON A BLIND DATE LIKE THAT.

469
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,747
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF BAD
DREAM YOU'RE HAVING.

470
00:35:57,747 --> 00:36:01,137
SHOULDN'T YOU GET OFF YOUR
ASS AND LOOK FOR A TRAVELER?

471
00:36:01,162 --> 00:36:02,886
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
BAD DREAM YOU'RE HAVING.

472
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:07,057
BUT HE JUST WANDERED INTO OUR STORE.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME.

473
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:10,727
THEN WHY DON'T YOU WAIT
FOR HIM AT THE STORE?

474
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:13,027
- AT THE STORE?
- YEAH.

475
00:36:19,903 --> 00:36:21,903
GOOD IDEA.

476
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:34,751
- I CAN'T REALLY PAY YOU, CAN I?
- YES! IT'S A SOCIAL STUDY.

477
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:39,256
OH, LEAVE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ME.
I'VE DONE ENOUGH IN SNACK BARS.

478
00:36:39,256 --> 00:36:44,561
IN THE MEANTIME, NOBI,
YOU CAN WRITE A SCRIPT OR SOMETHING.

479
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:46,496
WHAT ABOUT THE COMPANY? ARE YOU OKAY?

480
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:52,102
NO, I'M FINE. I'M CONNECTED TO THE COMPANY
BY REMOTE. I HEARD THAT IT IS CONNECTED.

481
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:57,274
- OH... CAN YOU TELL ME LATER?
- OKAY.

482
00:36:57,274 --> 00:37:01,563
OH, AND IF THIS TRAVELER-LOOKING
GUY COMES TO THE STORE...

483
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:03,880
IF THIS TRAVELER-LIKE PERSON COMES
TO THE STORE, PLEASE BE CAREFUL...

484
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,815
- I SHOULD REPORT IT?
- YES!

485
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:10,520
BUT I WONDER IF THIS WILL MAKE SENSE.

486
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,455
- EXCUSE ME.
- AH, WELCOME!

487
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:14,391
- WELCOME!
- THERE ARE TWO OF US.

488
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:17,201
ARE THERE TWO OF YOU?
PLEASE COME THIS WAY.

489
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:19,229
OH, THERE ARE TWO OF YOU!

490
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:22,065
- YES, SIR.
- YES!

491
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:25,402
MARI... TOTSO...?

492
00:37:25,402 --> 00:37:28,905
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING~!

493
00:37:28,905 --> 00:37:31,408

494
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:35,408
- MA.... MATRITUZZO~.
- YES...

495
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,749
- ARE YOU ALONE?
- YES... YES.

496
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:43,086
DO YOU COME TO THESE PLACES OFTEN?

497
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:45,786
CLOSE, CLOSE! EXCUSE ME!

498
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:49,424
MA....

499
00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:53,797
MA!

500
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:59,502
OH, THE CLOCK IS SO NICE!
I'M INTERESTED IN WATCHES TOO...

501
00:37:59,502 --> 00:38:02,706
SO CLOSE, CLOSE! I'M SORRY.

502
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:08,578
MARI... TOZZO?

503
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,778
IT IS!

504
00:38:12,716 --> 00:38:16,519
- YES, STRAWBERRY MILK.
- YES.

505
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:20,724
THANK YOU FOR WAITING.
TAPIOCA STRAWBERRY MILK.

506
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:23,024
- THANK YOU.
- THANKS.

507
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:27,928


508
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:32,402
WHAT, YOU'RE BORED ALREADY?

509
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:35,071
I'M JUST GOING TO SERVE TAPIOCA.

510
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:38,571
IT'S NOT A SNACK BAR.

511
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:49,285
I'VE BEEN AWARE OF IT FOR A WHILE, BUT THE
PEOPLE AT 2022 REALLY LIKE IT, DON'T THEY?

512
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:50,729
IS THAT?

513
00:38:50,754 --> 00:38:52,689
A SMART PHONE?

514
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:56,196
WE'RE IN A COFFEE SHOP AND
EVERYONE'S LOOKING AT THEIR SCREENS.

515
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,194
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT A PHONE?

516
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:01,865
NO, IT'S NOT JUST THE PHONE.

517
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:04,439
THAT ONE'S PROBABLY
LOOKING AT THE INTERNET.

518
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:07,037
THAT ONE IS USING SNS WITH PICTURES.

519
00:39:07,037 --> 00:39:11,875
NEXT TO THAT, MAYBE A GAME.

520
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:15,512
- GEROGERO.
- GEROGERO?

521
00:39:15,512 --> 00:39:19,049
I'M A LITTLE SAD.

522
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:21,549
YOU'RE LONELY...

523
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,057
AH, BECAUSE THERE IS NO SOUND.

524
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:33,830
I FORGOT THE BACKGROUND MUSIC.
PUT IT ON, WITH THIS.

525
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,830
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT...

526
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:47,544
WOH! I WAS SURPRISED.

527
00:39:47,544 --> 00:40:01,424


528
00:40:01,424 --> 00:40:03,760
NO ONE IS LISTENING TO IT.

529
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,097


530
00:40:07,097 --> 00:40:10,967
- PAPA~
- HMM?

531
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:17,741
- THE SONG'S CHANGED.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

532
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:26,950


533
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:31,450
DAD, CAN YOU COME TO THE RECITAL?

534
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:36,623
I SING ALONE IN SOME PARTS.

535
00:40:40,463 --> 00:40:44,463
- HEY, DAD.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

536
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:02,118


537
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:04,120
HEY, HEY.

538
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,423


539
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:11,928


540
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:22,438


541
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:30,955


542
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:36,452


543
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:41,124


544
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,960


545
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,995
EH?

546
00:41:45,995 --> 00:41:50,600


547
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:59,742


548
00:41:59,742 --> 00:42:09,419


549
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:17,927


550
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:23,566
- I'M GOING TO TAKE A PICTURE OF IT.
- LET'S TAKE A PICTURE.

551
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:27,937


552
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:32,575


553
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:37,113
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

554
00:42:37,113 --> 00:42:40,016


555
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:44,454


556
00:42:44,454 --> 00:42:48,958


557
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:53,830


558
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:58,635


559
00:42:58,635 --> 00:43:07,744


560
00:43:07,744 --> 00:43:17,086


561
00:43:17,086 --> 00:43:26,562


562
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,098


563
00:43:29,098 --> 00:43:31,134


564
00:43:31,134 --> 00:43:33,192
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

565
00:43:33,217 --> 00:43:34,288


566
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:38,274
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

567
00:43:38,274 --> 00:43:40,576


568
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:45,415


569
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:54,590


570
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,960


571
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,395


572
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:02,298


573
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:04,534


574
00:44:04,534 --> 00:44:06,469


575
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:13,276


576
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:17,914
YEAH~YES! HAHAHAHA...

577
00:44:17,914 --> 00:44:20,416
- FUU~.
- CUTE~!

578
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:25,254
- WAS IT DONE?
- IT WAS GOOD. IT WAS CUTE~.

579
00:44:25,254 --> 00:44:27,190
IT'S SO MUCH FUN!

580
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:31,561
WE WENT SHOPPING.
WE ATE A LOT OF DELICIOUS FOOD.

581
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:35,561
- THAT WAS GOOD, WASN'T IT?
- I HAD A GOOD TIME.

582
00:44:48,444 --> 00:44:53,950


583
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,586
I'M ALREADY UP.

584
00:44:56,586 --> 00:44:59,055


585
00:44:59,055 --> 00:45:01,891


586
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:05,395
- WHAT? TV!
- HEY, KNOCK ON THE DOOR!

587
00:45:05,395 --> 00:45:08,231
THERE'S NO DOOR.
WHAT? WHEN DID THEY START FILMING?

588
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:12,902
SO IT'S NOT TV.
IT'S TV. EH, NATIONAL TV?

589
00:45:12,902 --> 00:45:17,740
I MEAN, IT'S BEING BROADCAST
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

590
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,244
OH, IS THAT A LETTER
FROM SOMEONE WHO SAW IT?

591
00:45:21,244 --> 00:45:25,915
- YOU ARE A GOOD SINGER, AREN'T YOU?
- EH, I GOT A COMPLIMENT!

592
00:45:25,915 --> 00:45:29,115
IT GOT QUITE A FEW VIEWS.

593
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,258
THE TRAVELER WILL WATCH TOO.

594
00:45:35,258 --> 00:45:39,128
YEAH, IT'S POSSIBLE, ISN'T IT?
IF HE GETS ON SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES.

595
00:45:39,128 --> 00:45:43,132
SNS? IS THAT A TV STATION?

596
00:45:43,132 --> 00:45:48,771
I THINK YOU SOUND LIKE MY MOTHER SOMETIMES.

597
00:45:48,771 --> 00:45:52,071
I'M SORRY, I'M AN OLD PERSON.

598
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:04,581
- I'M GOING TO TAKE A BATH.
- OH, WELL, I'M SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING.

599
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:10,391
- OOPS...
- SORRY.

600
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:13,467
"AFTER A WHILE"

601
00:46:16,766 --> 00:46:19,235
OH, NO, NO, NO...

602
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,170
LATE ON THE FIRST DAY BACK AT WORK?

603
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:26,109
OH, MY GOD, I'M IN TROUBLE.
OH, AM I USING THE RIGHT WORD?

604
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:28,544
YES.

605
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:32,844
OH, HERE.

606
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,955
THIS IS NO WAY...

607
00:46:38,955 --> 00:46:42,792
OUR LEFTOVERS FROM YESTERDAY'S DINNER.
I JUST PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.

608
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:47,630
NO WAY. A MAN GIVING A WOMAN A LUNCH BOX?

609
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,266
LOOK, YOU'RE LATE!

610
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:55,466
- NO, REIWA'S MAN IS AWESOME! I'M OFF!
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.

611
00:46:57,507 --> 00:47:02,211
- AND PUT A NUMBER HERE.
- NUMBERS? - YES.

612
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:05,515
- 4... ZERO, ZERO, ZERO.
- YES

613
00:47:05,515 --> 00:47:08,217
- AND ENTER.
- ENTER. OOPS!

614
00:47:08,217 --> 00:47:12,722
- SEE HOW THE GRAPH HAS CHANGED?
- IT'S DONE.

615
00:47:12,722 --> 00:47:14,949
I THINK IT'S CUTE THAT GIRLS
ARE WEAK WITH MACHINES.

616
00:47:14,973 --> 00:47:16,893
THAT'S OLD-FASHIONED.
THAT'S PREJUDICE.

617
00:47:16,893 --> 00:47:20,763
THAT'S RIGHT. MIURA-SAN. YOU SHOULD
BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT KIND OF THING.

618
00:47:20,763 --> 00:47:22,763
I'M SORRY.

619
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:26,869
WHERE IS THE
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT?

620
00:47:26,894 --> 00:47:28,604
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT
IS ON THE THIRD FLOOR.

621
00:47:28,604 --> 00:47:31,404
OH. THIS WAY PLEASE.

622
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,749
THE CAFE WAITRESS WHO SINGS?

623
00:47:39,749 --> 00:47:43,920

624
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,955

CAFE CLERKS SINGING!   - VIDEO

626
00:47:48,244 --> 00:47:49,792
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS UPLOADING THEM.

627
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:51,794
YEAH, ONCE A WEEK.

628
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:56,933

629
00:47:56,933 --> 00:47:59,835

632
00:48:08,211 --> 00:48:11,881
HMMM...BUT IT'S NICE, ISN'T IT?

633
00:48:11,881 --> 00:48:15,751
- TODAY IS A DATE WITH PIYOMARU.
- THAT'S NICE! EH~.

634
00:48:15,751 --> 00:48:18,754

638
00:48:28,898 --> 00:48:32,735


639
00:48:32,735 --> 00:48:40,243


640
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:52,822


641
00:48:52,822 --> 00:48:59,729


642
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:12,708


643
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:15,378
AH~ KAEDE~!

644
00:49:15,378 --> 00:49:17,313

646
00:49:20,516 --> 00:49:26,389


647
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:30,893


648
00:49:30,893 --> 00:49:38,768


649
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:42,905


650
00:49:42,905 --> 00:49:46,776


651
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:54,917


652
00:49:54,917 --> 00:49:57,953
- WHOA!
- WAAA! I'M SO SURPRISED!

653
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,423
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

654
00:50:00,423 --> 00:50:09,131


655
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:13,040
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE SINGING
CAFÉ WAITRESS, SAE ISONO THIS IS

656
00:50:13,064 --> 00:50:16,972
A PROMISING YOUNG THEATRICAL
TROUPE, THE FOGHORN THEATRE COMPANY.

657
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,809
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO UPLOAD YOUR OWN VIDEOS.

658
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:25,114


659
00:50:25,114 --> 00:50:32,988


660
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:37,293


661
00:50:37,293 --> 00:50:40,596


662
00:50:40,596 --> 00:50:51,296


663
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:55,976
KNOCK KNOCK.

664
00:51:33,282 --> 00:51:40,982
I MIGHT WANT TO STAY IN THIS WORLD FOREVER.

665
00:51:50,132 --> 00:52:22,932


666
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:24,932
THAT?

667
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:31,440
MR. UEKI!

668
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,109
SAE-CHAN!
IT'S BEEN A WHILE!

669
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,146
LONG TIME NO SEE!
UEKI-SAN, YOU'RE HERE TOO!

670
00:52:37,146 --> 00:52:40,449
- OVER HERE?
- OVER HERE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

671
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:43,118
NO, NO, NO, I'M DRINKING~.

672
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,955
SINCE THE ARK STOPPED SERVING SNACKS
I DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO.

673
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:48,190
WHAT DID YOU DO? COULD YOU HAVE
BEEN A SINGER?

674
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,801
WHAT? DID I MENTION THAT?

675
00:52:50,826 --> 00:52:53,829
YOU DID SAY THAT. YOU LOVES TO SING...

676
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:58,901
I'M SINGING IN AN ARK THAT HAS
BECOME A CAFE. COME AND LISTEN.

677
00:52:58,901 --> 00:53:01,937
I'M IN A RECESSION AT MY COMPANY.
BUT I'M STILL IN A SLUMP.

678
00:53:01,937 --> 00:53:05,241
OI-CHAN, I'M GOING TO GO
OUT WITH ALL MY SLEEVES.

679
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:08,741
- YOU'VE GOT TO COME!
- I'M COMING!

680
00:53:16,852 --> 00:53:19,788
ARE YOU AN ASPIRING SINGER?

681
00:53:19,788 --> 00:53:23,488
I DON'T KNOW.

682
00:53:25,427 --> 00:53:27,763
I SEE...

683
00:53:27,763 --> 00:53:35,938
NOBORU IS A PLAYWRIGHT.
THAT'S GREAT.

684
00:53:35,938 --> 00:53:38,774
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE A LIVING AT IT.

685
00:53:38,774 --> 00:53:42,074
I'M JUST A HIRED MANAGER OF A CAFE.

686
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:47,149
- I READ YOUR SCRIPT.
- WHAT?

687
00:53:47,149 --> 00:53:51,287
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING.

688
00:53:51,287 --> 00:53:54,123
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

689
00:53:54,123 --> 00:53:59,528
EMOTIONS ARE INTENSE?
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A BUZZ.

690
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:03,232
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

691
00:54:03,232 --> 00:54:09,079
THE SCENE WHERE THE HERO GENTLY
REACHES OUT TO HIS LOVER IN THE DISTANCE.

692
00:54:09,104 --> 00:54:11,304
I LOVE THAT PART.

693
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,542
I LIKE THAT PART, TOO.

694
00:54:28,757 --> 00:54:34,057
OH... NO, IT'S NOTHING.

695
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:41,270


696
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:49,011
TAKE ME TO THE SEA.

697
00:54:49,011 --> 00:54:52,781
ON A SHIRT SMELLING OF CIGARETTES

698
00:54:52,781 --> 00:54:56,652
GENTLY, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO LEAN IN.

699
00:54:56,652 --> 00:55:02,891


700
00:55:02,891 --> 00:55:10,766


701
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:17,406


702
00:55:17,406 --> 00:55:23,545


703
00:55:23,545 --> 00:55:29,084


704
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:35,424


705
00:55:35,424 --> 00:55:46,568


706
00:55:46,568 --> 00:56:18,500


707
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,071
AH~ HEY, HEY, HEY!
WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT! HAHAHA...

708
00:56:22,071 --> 00:56:24,713
HEY, AFTER THIS, THERE'S A
MEETING OF THE THEATER TROUPE.

709
00:56:24,737 --> 00:56:26,241
CAN I USE YOUR PLACE FOR A BIT?

710
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:33,916
- OH, I'LL MAKE YOU SOME DINNER.
- REALLY? YOU CAN COOK?

711
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:36,552
I CAN MAKE IT!

712
00:56:36,552 --> 00:56:39,922
- THEN, PLEASE.
- YES. THEN, THIS ONE, PLEASE.

713
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:41,857
- THANK YOU.
- YES.

714
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:48,857


715
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:55,104


716
00:56:55,104 --> 00:56:58,874
- MOTHER!
- I'M HOME.

717
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:01,074
WELCOME HOME.

718
00:57:06,515 --> 00:57:13,388
- EVEN DINNER FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
- IF YOU'RE COMING BACK, TELL ME FIRST.

719
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:19,895
- UH-HUH... BECAUSE... I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU IN PERSON.    - WHAT?

720
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:25,534
FROM WHAT I'VE READ, THIS
TAPIOCA CRAZE IT WON'T LAST.

721
00:57:25,534 --> 00:57:29,034
UMMM... NO WAY.

722
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:40,082
- REALLY?  - REALLY
I THINK NOW IS THE TIME TO QUIT.

723
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:43,919
- I WANT TO OPEN A STORE HERE.
- HMM?

724
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:49,558
- LE CABARET DES BAS-FONDS.
- WHAT?

725
00:57:49,558 --> 00:57:51,493
FRENCH STYLE.

726
00:57:51,493 --> 00:57:57,266
IT WAS MY DREAM TO OPEN A BEAUTIFUL
KARAOKE SNACK BAR. IT WAS MY DREAM.

727
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:59,365
HEY! SO WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO THE CAFE?

728
00:57:59,389 --> 00:58:01,236
OH, THE CAFÉ.
IT WILL BE CLOSED.

729
00:58:01,236 --> 00:58:04,039
- WHAT? WHAT ABOUT NOBORU?
- OF COURSE I KNOW HIM.

730
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:09,845
WELL, HE HAS HIS DAY JOB, TOO.
HE SAID IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

731
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:15,050
SO, NOBORU, HE'S GOING
TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE...

732
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:17,050
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

733
00:58:24,393 --> 00:58:31,166
WELL THEN, THANKS FOR ALL
YOUR HARD WORK SO FAR! CHEERS!

734
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:34,366
CHEERS!

735
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:44,279
ARE YOU CELEBRATING THE COMPLETION
OF THE SCRIPT? I KNOW, RIGHT?

736
00:58:44,279 --> 00:58:47,282
- OH, NO!
- OH, NO! DON'T TELL ME WHAT'S IN THERE.

737
00:58:47,282 --> 00:58:52,754
SPOILERS, YOU MEAN? NO!
THUS, I'M CURIOUS.

738
00:58:52,754 --> 00:58:59,561
I HAVEN'T FINISHED WRITING.
WE'RE BREAKING UP.

739
00:58:59,561 --> 00:59:03,398
WHAT? YOU'RE DISSOLVING THE TROUPE?

740
00:59:03,398 --> 00:59:07,369
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT UNTIL THE NEXT SHOW.
BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD IT ANYMORE.

741
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:10,706
- I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS.
- BUT WE WORKED PRETTY HARD, DIDN'T WE?

742
00:59:10,706 --> 00:59:12,641
WE ARE THE BEST IN OUR GENERATION.

743
00:59:12,641 --> 00:59:15,755
WHY NOT? NOBORU-KUN, AREN'T YOU
GOING TO STOP WORKING AT THE CAFÉ?

744
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,479
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO
CONCENTRATE ON YOUR ACTING.

745
00:59:17,479 --> 00:59:22,718
- NO... BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SELL.
- BUT...

746
00:59:22,718 --> 00:59:25,520
SAE...

747
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:32,227
YOU ARE FREE TO DO IT, YOU ARE FREE
NOT TO DO IT. THAT'S THE ERA, RIGHT?

748
00:59:32,227 --> 00:59:35,527
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

749
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:41,536
OKAY, YOU CAN ALL DRINK
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.

750
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:45,240
- IT'S ON ME!
- YESSSS~!

751
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,543
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I THINK I'LL GET SOME KNOB.

752
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,709
THANK YOU. HEY, DID
YOU EAT THE RICE BALL?

753
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:51,446
I DID.

754
00:59:51,446 --> 00:59:53,946
ARE YOU EATING?

755
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,852
JUST SOMETHING SIMPLE, RIGHT?

756
01:00:06,295 --> 01:00:08,495
I WILL MISS YOU.

757
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:20,269
IT CAN'T BE HELPED.
I'LL SEE YOU ALL AGAIN.

758
01:00:22,506 --> 01:00:24,186
I WANTED YOU TO TELL ME.

759
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:30,277
I WANTED YOU TO TELL ME ABOUT
QUITTING THE TROUPE AND MOVING OUT.

760
01:00:38,727 --> 01:00:42,927
I HAVE TO REFRAIN FROM
TALKING ABOUT DARK THINGS.

761
01:00:45,467 --> 01:00:49,267
I'M JUST A ROOMMATE.

762
01:00:56,178 --> 01:01:00,415
BORING, SHARING A HOUSE.

763
01:01:00,415 --> 01:01:10,559


764
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,397
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

765
01:01:15,397 --> 01:01:17,933
JUBILEE? DID SHE REMARRY?

766
01:01:17,933 --> 01:01:21,013
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THE CONTRACT EXPIRED, NORMALLY.

767
01:01:21,037 --> 01:01:22,571
OUT OF CONTRACT?

768
01:01:22,571 --> 01:01:27,271
BUT IT'S NOT EXPIRATION, IT'S TERMINATION.
DISPATCH TERMINATION.

769
01:01:29,111 --> 01:01:31,811
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

770
01:01:33,582 --> 01:01:36,582
I'M UNEMPLOYED WITH CHILDREN.

771
01:01:39,454 --> 01:01:42,124
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

772
01:01:42,124 --> 01:01:52,601


773
01:01:52,601 --> 01:01:56,471
IT'S ITTY BITTY TO BE EXCITED, ISN'T IT?

774
01:01:56,471 --> 01:02:00,909
THE WAY YOU ARE TALKING IS OLD AND WEEDY.

775
01:02:00,909 --> 01:02:03,409
IS THIS A BAD WORD?

776
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:12,921
- WAKA-SA~.
- HMM?

777
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:15,557
DO YOU LIKE THIS PERIOD?

778
01:02:15,557 --> 01:02:19,857
- HMMM... I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
- WHY?

779
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:28,103
- MAYBE I DIDN'T SEE IT.
- WHAT?

780
01:02:28,103 --> 01:02:32,274
IN THIS PERIOD
I ONLY SAW THE GOOD PARTS.

781
01:02:32,274 --> 01:02:36,144
WHAT? ARE YOU SAYING THAT
THE OLD DAYS WERE BETTER?

782
01:02:36,144 --> 01:02:38,947
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

783
01:02:38,947 --> 01:02:49,447
BUT IF WE HAD STAYED IN OUR ORIGINAL WORLD
I WONDER WHAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE.

784
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,624
I WANTED YOU TO READ IT FIRST.

785
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:32,565
I'M OFF TO STOCK UP TOMORROW.

786
01:04:04,533 --> 01:04:06,468
WHAT'S UP?

787
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:11,268
YOU'RE TRYING TO WRITE SOMETHING
INTERESTING LIKE THIS. YOU CAN'T STOP!

788
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:18,380
I'M NOT GOING TO
STOP WRITING AT ALL.

789
01:04:18,404 --> 01:04:21,950
EVEN IF I GET A JOB, I'LL
CONTINUE TO WRITE IN DETAIL...

790
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:26,755
YOU WANT TO GET A JOB?
WHILE WRITING?

791
01:04:26,755 --> 01:04:30,091
I'M NOT AIMING FOR IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

792
01:04:30,091 --> 01:04:32,291
- I JUST LIKE IT...
- LIAR.

793
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:40,268
I JUST WANT TO DO IT AT MY OWN PACE.

794
01:04:40,268 --> 01:04:47,968
I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO
THAN SELL OR MAKE MONEY OR WHATEVER.

795
01:04:49,578 --> 01:04:55,784
YOU WANT TO BE RICH AND HAVE A NICE CAR.
OR WANT TO WORK HARD AND GET AHEAD.

796
01:04:55,784 --> 01:04:59,221
YOU WANT THAT.

797
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:03,525
YOU ARE TOO HUMBLE NOW.
MAKING FUN OF UPWARD MOBILITY

798
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:07,229
IN A WORLD OF CONVENIENCE.
IT'S JUST A SMALL GROUP.

799
01:05:07,229 --> 01:05:09,929
HEY, WAIT!

800
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:22,544
I KNOW, RIGHT?

801
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,951
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD SINGER.

802
01:05:24,975 --> 01:05:27,382
YOU GAVE UP BEING A SINGER, DIDN'T YOU?
IT'S THE SAME THING.

803
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:30,919
NO, IT'S NOT.

804
01:05:30,919 --> 01:05:33,619
IN THE REAL WORLD....

805
01:05:37,092 --> 01:05:43,592
IN THE REAL WORLD... I
WANTED TO BE A SINGER.

806
01:05:45,267 --> 01:05:53,267
BUT... INSTEAD OF REALLY TRYING...
I MADE EXCUSES AND RAN AWAY.

807
01:05:57,512 --> 01:05:59,512
YOU RAN AWAY, DIDN'T YOU?

808
01:06:02,717 --> 01:06:07,055
JUST BE YOUR TRUE SELF.

809
01:06:07,055 --> 01:06:14,855
THERE IS, ISN'T THERE? THERE
IS A REAL WORLD, ISN'T THERE?

810
01:06:17,065 --> 01:06:20,935
THEN...

811
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,939
I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.

812
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,776
HUH? WHAT?

813
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:29,976
ENOUGH.

814
01:06:45,427 --> 01:06:51,099
FOR EXAMPLE, EVEN IF I AM WRONG...

815
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:56,571


816
01:06:56,571 --> 01:07:10,518


817
01:07:10,518 --> 01:07:14,723


818
01:07:14,723 --> 01:07:17,759


819
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:25,233


820
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:35,877


821
01:07:35,877 --> 01:07:42,250


822
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:48,923


823
01:07:48,923 --> 01:07:55,263


824
01:07:55,263 --> 01:08:01,503


825
01:08:01,503 --> 01:08:08,710


826
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:15,383


827
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:22,257


828
01:08:22,257 --> 01:08:28,096


829
01:08:28,096 --> 01:08:36,404


830
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:59,204


831
01:09:06,034 --> 01:09:08,334
SAE!

832
01:09:21,516 --> 01:09:29,057


833
01:09:29,057 --> 01:09:35,830


834
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:42,237


835
01:09:42,237 --> 01:09:49,744


836
01:09:49,744 --> 01:09:57,085


837
01:09:57,085 --> 01:10:07,285


838
01:10:17,105 --> 01:10:38,126


839
01:10:38,126 --> 01:10:44,299
I FOUND YOU. IT'S A MIRACLE.

840
01:10:44,299 --> 01:10:46,334
DID YOU LOOK FOR ME?

841
01:10:46,334 --> 01:10:50,605


842
01:10:50,605 --> 01:10:53,808
IT'S LIKE AN OLD DRAMA.

843
01:10:53,808 --> 01:11:33,108


844
01:11:37,285 --> 01:11:41,785
- OH, IT'S DAZZLING.
- OH, SORRY, SORRY.

845
01:11:49,998 --> 01:11:52,198
I'LL DO IT.

846
01:11:57,405 --> 01:11:59,605
THANKS.

847
01:12:08,549 --> 01:12:11,753
ARE YOU LEAVING?

848
01:12:11,753 --> 01:12:14,422
WHAT?

849
01:12:14,422 --> 01:12:16,722
TO THE REAL WORLD.

850
01:12:27,435 --> 01:12:34,776
I'M THINKING OF DOING A LITTLE MORE.

851
01:12:34,776 --> 01:12:37,679
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

852
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:43,951
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE WITH THE TROUPE.
I WANT TO DO MY BEST.

853
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:46,988


854
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:52,788
BUT... I'M SUPER NERVOUS.

855
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,235
WHAT?

856
01:13:01,235 --> 01:13:06,741
I'M THINKING THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE EVER TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT.

857
01:13:06,741 --> 01:13:12,246
OH... I DON'T KNOW.

858
01:13:12,246 --> 01:13:15,550
YEAH.

859
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:19,350
WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

860
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:28,129
I'M GOING TO GO CHANGE MY CLOTHES.

861
01:13:28,129 --> 01:13:35,436


862
01:13:35,436 --> 01:13:38,272
I KNEW IT WAS TRUE.

863
01:13:38,272 --> 01:13:44,779
EVEN IF TIMES CHANGE, EVEN IF THE
WORLD CHANGES, NOTHING CHANGES.

864
01:13:44,779 --> 01:13:48,079
I HAVE TO CHANGE.

865
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:56,720
- SAE-CHAN!
- YOU'RE SO CUTE!

866
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:06,901
TODAY'S THE FAREWELL PARTY OF CAFE ARK.

867
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:12,240
IT'S ALSO A ONE-NIGHT REVIVAL PARTY.

868
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,175
YES!

869
01:14:14,175 --> 01:14:20,948
NO CHARGE WILL BE MADE. DRINKING AND
SINGING, CELEBRATE THE ARK'S NEW BEGINNING!

870
01:14:20,948 --> 01:14:22,950
YES~YES!

871
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:27,421


872
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:31,425
CUTE!

873
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,562
BEAUTIFUL!

874
01:14:34,562 --> 01:14:42,270
TODAY, TOO, SOMEONE IS INTOXICATED BY SONG

875
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:48,943
SONGS CONNECT PEOPLE TO PEOPLE,
SONGS ARE FOR EVERYONE

876
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,878


877
01:14:50,878 --> 01:14:57,285


878
01:14:57,285 --> 01:15:04,058


879
01:15:04,058 --> 01:15:07,395


880
01:15:07,395 --> 01:15:09,695
GIVE ME A BEER, PLEASE!

881
01:15:12,066 --> 01:15:16,404
- THANKS FOR YOUR HARD WORK~.
- THANKS.   - YOU WERE CUTE!

882
01:15:16,404 --> 01:15:19,240
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

883
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,175


884
01:15:21,175 --> 01:15:27,415
- OH, HEY, I GOT A NEW PLACE TO WORK~.
- WE'RE GLAD~.

885
01:15:27,415 --> 01:15:31,085
I THINK I CAN MANAGE THE DAY-CARE
CENTER TOO. I'M SORRY FOR WORRYING YOU.

886
01:15:31,085 --> 01:15:34,422
- NO PROBLEM.
- THEN WE HAVE TO DRINK.

887
01:15:34,422 --> 01:15:40,094
- WE HAVE TO DRINK.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

888
01:15:40,094 --> 01:15:44,432
SAE!
LEAVE IT TO ME!

889
01:15:44,432 --> 01:15:47,335
- HMM?
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

890
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:52,573
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

891
01:15:52,573 --> 01:15:54,111
THOSE GUYS.

892
01:15:54,135 --> 01:15:58,773
THAT'S GOOD. ISN'T
THAT THE POWER OF SONG?

893
01:16:01,282 --> 01:16:03,482
SAE.

894
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:10,687
SING IT. THE LAST SONG.

895
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:14,595
YEAH...

896
01:16:14,595 --> 01:16:23,537


897
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,073
- WAIT A MINUTE.
- YEAH.

898
01:16:26,073 --> 01:16:34,749


899
01:16:34,749 --> 01:16:39,620
I JUST WANTED TO
HEAR YOUR SONG AGAIN.

900
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:42,423
I HAD A FEELING YOU WOULD COME.

901
01:16:42,423 --> 01:16:57,505


902
01:16:57,505 --> 01:17:02,209
WERE YOU HAPPY
IN A DIFFERENT TIME?

903
01:17:02,209 --> 01:17:07,381


904
01:17:07,381 --> 01:17:09,317
WHEN I GO BACK....

905
01:17:09,317 --> 01:17:12,887


906
01:17:12,887 --> 01:17:17,758
IF I GO BACK, EVERYTHING WILL BE GONE?

907
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:23,898


908
01:17:23,898 --> 01:17:28,769
WHAT'S INSIDE YOU
WON'T DISAPPEAR.

909
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:54,469


910
01:17:56,263 --> 01:18:01,035

BACK TO THE ORIGINAL TIME
EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL THOUGH.

961
01:24:19,413 --> 01:24:23,417
A LITTLE BIT I CHANGED.

962
01:24:23,417 --> 01:24:28,717
WORKING HARD.
I KEEP AUDITIONING

963
01:24:34,428 --> 01:24:40,728
MY MOTHER HERE ALSO HAD A CHANGE. SHE STARTED
SAYING SHE WAS GOING TO STUDY IN FRANCE

964
01:24:43,137 --> 01:24:48,442
MOM, I'M AMAZED YOU
DECIDED TO STUDY ABROAD.

965
01:24:48,442 --> 01:24:55,949
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING,
DON'T YOU? I'M SURE YOU'LL START SOMEDAY.

966
01:24:55,949 --> 01:24:57,949
I THINK SO.

967
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,020
THE REMAINING FIRE THAT WAS SMOLDERING IN
YOUR HEART, I THINK IT'S STARTING TO BURN.

968
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:14,862
I HOPE IT WASN'T TOO
HARD FOR DAD.

969
01:25:16,804 --> 01:25:19,773
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHAT?

970
01:25:19,773 --> 01:25:25,913
ACH... YOUR FATHER, YOU KNOW.
HE WAS ON FIRE.

971
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:32,085
HE ALREADY LIVED OUT HIS LIFE THE WAY HE
WANT TO, AND BURNED UP COMPLETELY. PHEW.

972
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:47,568


973
01:25:47,568 --> 01:25:49,503
DONE.

974
01:25:49,503 --> 01:26:04,718


975
01:26:04,718 --> 01:26:08,055
SO... WAS IT?

976
01:26:08,055 --> 01:26:10,055
YES, IT WAS.

977
01:26:12,526 --> 01:26:18,726
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO PUT OUT YOUR FIRE.

978
01:26:22,903 --> 01:26:24,938
YEAH, I KNOW.

979
01:26:24,938 --> 01:26:34,638


980
01:27:24,398 --> 01:27:27,734
HELLO

981
01:27:27,734 --> 01:27:29,734
HELLO.

982
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:48,422
